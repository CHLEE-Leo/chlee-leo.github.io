  I am a postdoctoral associate at the graduate school of artificial intelligence in Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST).

  My research focuses on the interplay between generative models and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for developing controllable AI &mdash; especially in the context of large language models (LLMs). The goal of my research is to analyze the nature of controllability and utilize it to improve the controllability of AI. In this regard, academic keywords of personal interest are:
  <dl style="PADDING-LEFT: 40px">
	<dt>
		<li><b>Pareto Optimality</b></li>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>To build controllable AI, the generative model must be optimized for the likelihood and control objectives simultaneously (jointly). Given this multi-objective nature, studying controllability from the perspective of Pareto optimality can provide the theoretical foundations of controllable AI.</p>

		<!-- <li>Exposure Bias and Data Perturbation</li> -->
		<li><b>Maximum Mutual Information</b></li>

	<dd>
		<p>In terms of Pareto optimality, the more the Pareto improvement, the higher the controllability.

		<p>Computing mutual information is expensive, so it is necessary to "approximate" the maximum mutual information without estimating the exact amount of mutual information.

    <b>Figure.1 (Multi-objective Nature of CLMs (far-left) and How to achieve Pareto Improvement (far-right)):</b> The Pareto frontier is a boundary within the objective space where the set of optimal policies π* belongs to. Each point represents a combination of objectives achieved by the policy at that point. The <b><span style="color:red">red</span></b> arrow indicates that we cannot increase reward without sacrificing likelihood, while the <b><span style="color:blue">blue</span></b> arrow indicates vice versa.

  </div>
  <br>

  <p>
  <u>My research interest is to develop controllable language models (CLMs) for controllable sequence generation (CSG).</u> In general, I implement CLMs by treating LMs as agents and leveraging policy-based reinforcement learning (e.g., REINFORCE, TRPO, PPO, etc.,) to fine-tune the LM agents with human-instruction rewards. 
  <p>
  <u>More recently, my research focus has shifted to establishing the theoretical foundations of CLM</u> because I believe that relying on rules-of-thumb (i.e., unprincipled) practices in out-of-control situations can be disastrous in areas that will be increasingly dependent on AI (e.g., finance, medical, security, transportation, etc.). At this time, a theoretical understanding of the controllability will help minimize this risk.
  </p>

  <p>
  <u>Figure 1 describes my recent approach to CLMs from a theoretical perspective.</u> At the core of my approach is the assumption that <u><i>"developing controllable AI is equivalent to solving multi-objective optimization."</i></u> To be specific, controlling an AI model requires it to approximate real data distribution (i.e., likelihood objective) and obey user-intended directions (i.e., reward objective) simulataneously. <u>That is, developing CLMs is a problem of searching for an optimal solution where both likelihood and reward objectives are satisfied at the same time.</u>
  </p>

  <!--
  <p>
  Accordingly, <u>I hypothesized that the optimal solutions lie on the Pareto frontier,</u> as is typical for multi-objective optimization problems, <u>and that it is inevitable to sacrifice the likelihood for further increasing the reward.</u> These two hypotheses establish the theoretical foundation for the controllability of AI models, which is a unique aspect that distinguishes my approach from previous studies. You can see my work in recent papers that are <a href="assets/publications/2023_review/paper.pdf" target="_blank">under review</a> and <a href="assets/publications/2023_working/paper.pdf" target="_blank">in progress</a>.

  For the last two years of Ph.D., <u>I have published several papers proposing novel CLMs that specialize in real-world applications, </u> including diet planning [<a href="assets/publications/2021_diet_planning/paper.pdf" target="_blank">KDD'21</a>, <a href="assets/publications/2021_MIND_dataset/paper.pdf" target="_blank">NeurIPS'21</a>], operational recommendations [<a href="assets/publications/2022_recommendation_in_offline_stores/paper.pdf" target="_blank">KDD'22</a>], and drug repurposing [<a href="assets/publications/2023_working/paper.pdf" target="_blank">in progress</a>]. Figure 2 presents application examples of CSG, which can be addressed by CLMs.

  This research area is dissected into three elements: 1) sequential model, 2) control theory, and 3) generative framework. Therefore, the three elements must be considered in CSG research, and I usually take them into account according to the three steps as follows: 
  <ol style="PADDING-LEFT:40px">
  <li>Building the langauge models of high capacities to estimate sequential patterns (e.g., Seq2Seq, Transformers, GPT3, etc.,).</li>
  <li>Leveraging policy-based RL algorithms to induce controllability (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO, TRPO, etc.,).</li>
  <li>Optimizing the language models to be controllable using RL algorithms under the generative framework of unsupervised or self-supervised manners (e.g., AE, VAE, etc.,).</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  As mentioned above, my research boundary is grounded on the middle territory between NLG and RL. On this background, my research interest in CSGs is recently extending from real-world applications to theoretical understanding. Specifically, <b>I study the theoretical foundations of how RL and NLP techniques get intertwined and fused on the lens of Bayesian perspectives.</b> There are four reasons why I prefer the Bayesian approach:
  <ol style="PADDING-LEFT:40px">
	  <li>Bayesian methods are one of the most straightforward tools for dealing with conditional distributions.
		  <ul>
			 <li>RL is a learning framework that estimates the conditional distribution over actions given states according to the Markov decision process.</li>
			 <li>Language model describes a sequence by factorizing the joint distribution of words into the product of conditional distributions of tokens given previous tokens.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods provide us with a powerful backdoor, called Variational Bayes, to approximate intractable distributions difficult to estimate directly.
		  <ul>
			<li>Variational inference (VI), a mathematical framework for (approximately) doing Bayesian inference, is even computationally cheap because it can be converted to a dual problem, i.e., maximizing ELBO.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods imply the probabilistic status of unobserved states, and it means implicit data augmentation comes into play in the latent space.
	      <ul>
		    <li>RL requires as many observations as possible to estimate a policy that maximizes the reward.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods are open to introducing tricks such as marginalization so that we can easily derive useful properties such as the amount of information.</li>
  </ol>
  
  A paper titled " <a href="assets/publications/2023_levenshtein_agent/paper.pdf" target="_blank">Theoretical Principles of Controllable Generation</a> ," which deals with some of the topics related to the above four contents, was submitted to ICML'23, and is currently in the process of review. Recently, <b>I am thinking about how to introduce the concept of augmentation into CSG research in the causal perspective through the Bayesian method.</b>
