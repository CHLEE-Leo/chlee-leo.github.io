  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>
  In February 2023, <b>I completed my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and won the best researcher award.</b> My research area is at the intersection of natural language generation (NLG) and reinforcement learning (RL), and I wrote a dissertation on controllable sequence generation based on them. 
  <b>I'm joining UNIST Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence as a Postdoc researcher, starting March 2023.</b>
  Currently, I belong to <a href="https://service.unist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">the Service Engineering & Knowledge Discovery Lab</a>, which is led by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=NW7F08MAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao" target="_blank">Prof.Chiehyeon Lim</a>, my advisor whom I truly respect. 
  </p>
 
  <p>
  I got my B.Sc in Economics from Ajou University as an outstanding student in the top 10% of the major GPA. During this period, I was fascinated by the way economists view the world mathematically, and thus became interested in statistical modeling and data analysis.<br><br>
  
  In February 2016, to develop engineering capabilities required for data-driven research I entered the master's program at the Department of Industrial Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST). For the first one and a half years, I conducted research on the mathematical modeling of business dynamics in two-sided markets and the statistical validation of the model's predictions. However, as my advisor moved to the United States, I stopped studying for a while and did an internship as a data analyst at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard for half a year. During an internship, I was engaged in developing text-mining algorithms to automate documentation tasks or to analyze business insights. After completing the internship, I returned to UNIST, transferred to the combined master-Ph.D. course, and joined the lab of Prof.Chiehyeon Lim.<br><br>

  I spent the first two years of Ph.D. course (Jan 2018 - Feb 2020) solving real-world problems with advanced text-mining techniques. For example, using topic modeling such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com" target="_blank">Blei et al., 2003</a>), I analyzed the development trends of the 4th industrial revolution and blockchain technology, and developed a context-aware recommender system with the leverage of Word2Vec (<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/9aa42b31882ec039965f3c4923ce901b-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Mikolov et al., 2013</a>). These two studies gave me a deep understanding of Bayesian methods and language models respectively. For the last three years (Feb 2020 - Dec 2022), I focused on controllable sequence generation tasks with the aim of building a goal-oriented model. This is because I thought controlling models from the end user's perspective would become increasingly important in the future when AI enters our daily lives in earnest. In this context, my research goal was embodied as a study on how to combine RL and NLG methods. I have conducted several studies in application and theoretical aspects, and some of them were successfully published in top-tier conferences (KDD, NeurIPS, etc.,).
  <p/>

  <p>
  I dream of becoming a researcher who is willing to stand up against prejudice and inequality in the world with logical thinking and a scientific attitude.
  I am looking forward to a heart-pounding journey of research that will create a better world and promote the future with great colleagues.
  I will end this article by introducing a quote from one of my favorite scholars, Alfred Marshall:

  <h4>Research interest</h4>
  <p>
  My research interest lies on the area of <b>controllable sequence generation (CSG) </b> that can be dissected into three elements: 1) sequential model, 2) control theory, and 3) generative framework. Therefore, the three elements must be considered in CSG research, and I usually take them into account according to the three steps as follows: 
  <ol style="PADDING-LEFT:40px">
  <li>Building the langauge models of high capacities to estimate sequential patterns (e.g., Seq2Seq, Transformers, GPT3, etc.,).</li>
  <li>Leveraging policy-based RL algorithms to induce controllability (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO, TRPO, etc.,).</li>
  <li>Optimizing the language models to be controllable using RL algorithms under the generative framework of unsupervised or self-supervised manners (e.g., AE, VAE, etc.,).</li>
  </ol>
  
  For the last two years of Ph.D., <b>I moslty focused on developing novel methods that control the generative models to produce sequences as intended</b> following the three steps above <b>and tried to apply them to the real-world applications</b> such as diet planning [<a href="assets/publications/2021_diet_planning/paper.pdf" target="_blank">KDD'21</a>, <a href="assets/publications/2021_MIND_dataset/paper.pdf" target="_blank">NeurIPS'21</a>], operational recommendation [<a href="assets/publications/2022_recommendation_in_offline_stores/paper.pdf" target="_blank">KDD'22</a>], and drug repositioning [<a href="assets/publications/2023_levenshtein_agent/paper.pdf" target="_blank">ICML'23</a>] (<i>under-review</i>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  As mentioned above, my research boundary is grounded on the middle territory between NLG and RL. On this background, my research interest in CSGs is recently extending from real-world applications to theoretical understanding. Specifically, <b>I study the theoretical foundations of how RL and NLP techniques get intertwined and fused on the lens of Bayesian perspectives.</b> There are four reasons why I prefer the Bayesian approach:
  <ol style="PADDING-LEFT:40px">
	  <li>Bayesian methods are one of the most straightforward tools for dealing with conditional distributions.
		  <ul>
			 <li>RL is a learning framework that estimates the conditional distribution over actions given states according to the Markov decision process.</li>
			 <li>Language model describes a sequence by factorizing the joint distribution of words into the product of conditional distributions of tokens given previous tokens.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods provide us with a powerful backdoor, called Variational Bayes, to approximate intractable distributions difficult to estimate directly.
		  <ul>
			<li>Variational inference (VI), a mathematical framework for (approximately) doing Bayesian inference, is even computationally cheap because it can be converted to a dual problem, i.e., maximizing ELBO.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods imply the probabilistic status of unobserved states, and it means implicit data augmentation comes into play in the latent space.
	      <ul>
		    <li>RL requires as many observations as possible to estimate a policy that maximizes the reward.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods are open to introducing tricks such as marginalization so that we can easily derive useful properties such as the amount of information.</li>
  </ol>
  
  A paper titled " <a href="assets/publications/2023_levenshtein_agent/paper.pdf" target="_blank">Theoretical Principles of Controllable Generation</a> ," which deals with some of the topics related to the above four contents, was submitted to ICML'23, and is currently in the process of review. Recently, <b>I am thinking about how to introduce the concept of augmentation into CSG research in the causal perspective through the Bayesian method.</b>

  <h4>Looking for Post-doc Position</h4>
  <p>
  Currently, <b>I am looking for a postdoctoral position related to NLP and ML research.</b> I much prefer a position in a research team rather than a development or business team, but when it comes to the research topic, my utility curve is indifferent. In other words, I am welcome to any research topics originating from both academic and business issues.
